# Future Build List

1. **Decentralized Multi-Game Oracle** — Pyth-style on-demand price feeds but for gaming data (match results, stats, events). Could serve multiple games/providers with a pull-based oracle model.

2. **Speed Improvements** — Faster indexer processing, optimistic prediction creations (show predictions immediately before on-chain confirmation).

3. **Browser Extension** — Extend 4sight.gg functionality into a browser extension.

4. **Order Book Support** — Move from parimutuel market model to order book-based markets (limit orders, matching engine).

5. **Event Creation Controls** — More granular control over what kinds of events/markets a user can create for a given match (allowed market types, outcome templates, validation rules).

6. **Add More Games** — Expand beyond Dota 2 to support additional game titles (CS2, League of Legends, Valorant, etc.).

7. **Productionize** — Continuous monitoring (alerting, health checks, dashboards), robust CI/CD pipeline (automated tests, staging environment, zero-downtime deploys), proper infrastructure (IaC, scalable hosting, managed databases, load balancing).
